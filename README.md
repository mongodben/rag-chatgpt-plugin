This repository contains the source code for the **MongDbAssistant** [GPT for ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts).

It contains a plugin that does retrieval augmented generation to ground ChatGPT's answers in the MongoDB documentation. The plugin's source code is in the `mongodb-chatgpt-plugin` directory. The plugin is deployed to a Vercel serverless endpoint.

You can use the GPT here - <https://chat.openai.com/g/g-g4pJBXMe4-mongodbassistant>

It seems to work quite well. Try it out!
