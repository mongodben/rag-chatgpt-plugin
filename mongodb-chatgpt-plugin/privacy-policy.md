# Privacy Policy

This plugin does not retain any data from the user. It definitely **is not** an official MongoDB product.

It is a hack made in a weekend, and I don't really care how you use it.

However, logs are retained on the Vercel (serverless?) server, and I have no control over that. I probably won't look at them, but I might. Do not put any information in here that you don't want me to see.

Also, your queries are vectorized using the OpenAI embedding API, so they might retain some data. But they control ChatGPT, so they can already see your data. Generally, you probably shouldn't put data into ChatGPT any other OpenAI product that you wouldn't feel comfortable sharing with a stranger. The same probably applies for most of our digital lives, but that's a separate conversation.

Have fun and please don't spam the API too much. It uses my personal OpenAI account, and I don't want to 1) get banned 2) break the bank.

For any questions, email me at ben at perlmutter dot io.
